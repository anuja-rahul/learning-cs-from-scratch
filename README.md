# Learning stuff

## Getting Started

I hope this helps you just as it did when I was learning C#.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.

### Creating a New Project

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.
3. Run the following command to create a new console application:

    ```sh
    dotnet new console -o ./MyConsoleApp
    ```

    This will create a new directory named `MyConsoleApp` with the necessary files.

### Building the Project

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd MyConsoleApp
    ```

2. Run the following command to build the project:

    ```sh
    dotnet build
    ```

    This will compile the application and generate the necessary binaries.

### Running the Project

1. After building the project, run the following command to execute the application:

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

    You should see the output of your console application in the terminal.
